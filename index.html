					<h2><span class="highlight-alt">Olin College</span> - Parking Spot Finder</h2>
					<p>A multi piece installation which located free parking spots on campus. One unit was a camera housed in a weather proof enclosure. It surveyed spots and used computer vision to find free ones. The other unit was a indicator system which received signals from the camera, indicating generally which lot to use. There was also a webportal to see usage.
					<br/><br/>
					The whole system was powered by hand constructed weatherproof solar panels. This was done as part of a team of five, where I had the role of mechanical+integration lead (but also switch-hitter, so I also worked a small amount on all subsystems).   

					Work was done in Arduino/C, python, javascript and hardware.
